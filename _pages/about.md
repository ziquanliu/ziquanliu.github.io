Hi, I am Ziquan Liu, a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) at the School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science, Queen Mary University of London. I am affiliated with the Centre for Multimodal AI and the Computer Vision group, and an academic fellow at the Digital Environment Research Institute. My research interest is machine learning, including trustworthy and reliable machine learning, uncertainty of foundation models and interpretable machine learning. I worked as a postdoc research fellow in machine learning in Information, Inference and Machine Learning group at University College London from April to December of 2023. I spent five wonderful years at City University of Hong Kong in Video, Image, and Sound Analysis Lab as a PhD student under the supervision of Prof. Antoni B. Chan, and got my PhD in 2023. I obtained my Bachelor of Engineering in Information Engineering from Beihang University and secondary Bachelor of Science in Mathematics from the same university, both in 2017.
